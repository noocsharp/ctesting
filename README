A stupid, dumb simple c testing framework that is really pretty useless and will probably save me as much time as it took to write it.

start_test(char* name) - creates a new testing section, with name name.

end_test() - does about what you would expect it to do

start_subtest(char* name) - start_test but for a subtest

end_subtest(char* name) - tells you if the test succeeded

get_status() - prints the numbers of tests so far

assert_true(int b) - passes if the input isn't 0

assert_false(int b) - passes if the input is 0

assert_equals(void* to_check, void* source, int bytes) - compares bytes bytes at the two input pointers for equality
